# emotional_diary

## Briefing
This is my CS50 final project! It is a web app builded using Flask, when launched it showcases a login promp. If registered you can acces a calendar were you can chose of which "color" (emotion) was your day. You can configure in the settings the number of emotions and their colors. It is posible to change your password and recover it if you forgot it. Code design based on CS50 finance and Flask tutorial https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/
